## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing sales data from an Excel spreadsheet. The primary objective is to create a Power BI report with meaningful visualizations to understand key metrics such as the number of orders, total line total, total tax amount, total freight amount, and total due amount. The project aims to provide insights into sales performance using descriptive statistics and well-designed visuals.

## Project Steps:
### 1. Data Extraction:
